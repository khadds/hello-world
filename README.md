I am brand new to coding.  I am excited to learn what I can.
I am not sure if there is a limit to how much text you can have on any given line, so I will give it a shot.  I am also not sure if there are any characters you are not allowed to use. ?!@#$%^&*()_+":?';/|\}{][?></.,
We shall see.  I am not sure what I did to end up with italics and underlining.  I wonder if I can bold a character.  bold.  Nope.  BOLD.  Still nope.
Hmm.
I don't know how to get rid of this either.
